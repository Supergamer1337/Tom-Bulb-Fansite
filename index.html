            <h1 class="article-title no-top">We welcome thee, who have basked in the light of the bulb!</h1>
            <p>This site is made by us, the followers of Tom Bulb, in recognition of his superior intelligence, charm and, well, pretty much everything. We know that many have failed to recognize Bulb for the wonder that he is, but we hope that by using making this site the message can spread bring even more followers into our fold :). Thus, as the Followers of Tom Bulb grow, we can affect greater change in the wizarding world, making it easier for our lord and saviour to enact the change, that will improve all our livelihoods!</p>
            <h1 class="article-title">The Fansite's Path</h1>
            <p>So, what then, does this fansite then do to convince others in the glory of Tom Bulb? Well, primarily it serves as an archive to the thoughts and actions of Tom Bulb himself – as we believe that to not follow him after reading one of his selfless and majestic actions is rather... Lacking of brains. Thus, it is split into three different sections, accomplices, locations and journal.</p>
            <p>The first of these, accomplices, is the page where information about the current helpers of Tom Bulb can be found. Here we see his general thoughts about them, as well as a short introduction about who they are in his life. All so that you can see how you could learn to be one of them and learn how to please and help our most reverent Tom Bulb.</p>
            <p>The second section, locations, are records of important locations in Tom Bulb’s life. They could range anywhere from Hogwarts, to the entire nation of the United Kingdom. It all, frankly, depends on how much Tom Bulb cares about a location. After all, if the location wasn’t important enough to make an impression on our saviour, does it truly deserve to be remembered?</p>
            <p>The last section, the journal, is our proudest achievement to date. You see, we have convinced the glorious light himself, to share with us a direct link to his personal journal (from 3rd year and forwards). Thus, we will get a direct insight to his current life, actions and adventures – right as they happen! (There may be delay, thanks to the magic). If that doesn’t show how much better Tom Bulb is compared to other great figures in the wizarding world, we don’t know what could!</p>
            <p>After all this, if you don’t follow our lord and saviour – the glorious light of creation itself – we think you should find immediate help. Thankfully, the risk of that happening is incredibly low, after all, if you found someone akin to a god, would you doubt them?</p>
