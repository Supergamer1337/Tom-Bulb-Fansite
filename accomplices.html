            <h1 class="article-title">Who art mine accomplices?</h1>
            <p>As most of followers of Tom Bulb are aware, there are a few lucky people that get to spend a large amount of time with the Glorious Light himself. And though I know that most of us here are jealous (and some downright pissed that they seem to be unable to show the reverence of Tom Bulb that he so deserves), they are a relevant and influential part of his life; thus deserving of their own page.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-article-title">Phillip Hardwood</h1>
            <p>This guy seems to be the athletic of the group, and the most outgoing. As he’s relatively new in the life of Tom Bulb (and he doesn’t care all that much for him), there isn’t yet that much more to say here. However, worthy of note is the fact that many seem to recognize him as one of the closer friends of Bulb’s, which most of us know is complete bullshit. To Tom Bulb, Phillip Hardwood is nothing more than a tool – a pawn in his game – nothing more will he ever be.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-article-title">Johnson Dwanye</h1>
            <p>This man is perhaps even less well known to us than Philip Hardwood – despite him and Our Saviour belonging to the same house – however, we do know that he seems to be chatty and have a great interest in women (he must’ve just hit puberty...?). This can be surmised based on this sentence in Tom’s journal: “I don’t know, that Johnson Dwanye figure seems to be a bit too horny for us civilized people”.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-article-title">Joe Philips</h1>
            <p>Joe Phillips is seen by many as a loveable and quite... alarmed individual. His interactions with Tom Bulb seem to be limited to being in the same group during his first Hogsmeade weekend, where he was scared of, well, everything. Worthy of note is the fact that though he seems like a good person, he is not. His overexaggerated fear of everything puts a constant halt to m- Tom Bulb’s plans! As such, he is simply an annoying Hufflepuff and thus deserve to follow the rest of his house as unable to ever become a main character.</p>

            <h1 class="sub-article-title">Mad Mavis</h1>
            <p>What to say, I think nothing describes this girl better than the words of our Lord himself, “Annoyingly horrid bitch”. Though thanks to the efforts of Phillip Hardwood, it seems that he will have to withstand this fucking horrible excuse of a “reasearcher” for a while longer.</p>
