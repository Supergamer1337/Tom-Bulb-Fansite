                <img src="./images/hogwarts.jpg" alt="Hogwarts Castle">
                <p>Hogwarts Castle was a large, seven-storey high building supported by magic, with a hundred and forty two staircases throughout its many towers and turrets and very deep dungeons. The castle was built in the late Early Middle Ages (c. 993) by a wizard architect and the four most celebrated wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena Ravenclaw and Salazar Slytherin. The castle was the main building of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, regarded as the finest wizarding school in the world.</p>
                <p>Hogwarts was built in a valley area — surrounding mountains were part of the landscape — with the fairly large Great Lake to the south of the main building. The huge main oak front doors that led into the Entrance Hall faced west, and opened up to sloping lawns. The deep Forbidden Forest extended around to the west of the castle. There were also exterior greenhouses and vegetable patches on the school grounds.</p>
                <p>Hogwarts was located in the Scottish Highlands, near the all-wizard village of Hogsmeade and "not far" from Dufftown, in Moray, and Achintee, in Lochaber.</p>
                <p>It was the setting of the final battle of the Second Wizarding War, the Battle of Hogwarts, which resulted in the deaths of several witches and wizards who fought in defence of the castle, including Remus Lupin, Nymphadora Tonks, Fred Weasley, Colin Creevey, Lavender Brown, and Severus Snape. The castle was badly damaged in the battle, but ultimately the Order of the Phoenix won when Harry Potter defeated his nemesis, Lord Voldemort, in the Great Hall.</p>
                <p>Due to its extremely advanced age and the sheer amount of magic present in or around it, the castle was implied to have developed some form of sentience or awareness, such as when it sealed the Headmaster's Tower against Dolores Umbridge in 1996, and the various trick steps and false doors.</p>

                <p class="boldend accent-2">Commentary by the Great Light:</p>
                <p>“I don’t know really, growing up I heard all kinds of things about this ‘Hogwarts’ school (even though I already knew that it couldn’t teach me anything worthwhile) and became quite excited when I received my letter. Though now, during my third year, I realize that it is little more than a Scottish castle, and everyone is easily impressed by even slightly advanced magic, even though I could make something ten times more grand with a flick of the wrist.”</p>

            <h1 class="sub-article-title no-top">Hogsmeade</h1>
            <div class="text-with-picture">
                <img src="./images/hogsmeade.png" alt="Hogsmeade Village">
                <p>Hogsmeade Village, or simply called Hogsmeade, was the only all-wizarding village in Britain. It was founded by Hengist of Woodcroft. Since before 1714 (when the 1714 Edict was passed), Hogwarts third years and above had been permitted weekend trips into the village.</p>
                <p>Mainly, students frequented the High Street in the village, which contained the named speciality shops and pubs such as Zonko's Joke Shop and Honeydukes. Otherwise, they wandered on to observe the infamous Shrieking Shack.</p>
                <p>Hogsmeade was a picturesque little village of cottages and shops, with enchanted candles hanging in the trees during the holidays. It was also near the location of the train station used by the Hogwarts Express.</p>
                
                <p class="boldend accent-2">Commentary by the Great Light:</p>
                <p>“Even I, Tom Bulb the Great, must admit that there is something slightly picturesque about the village of Hogsmeade. Whether it is the eternal snow that seems to have befallen it, shimmering in the light of the sun, or simply the well-worn old houses it consists of. Though, as a side note, it would’ve been much better if all the incompetent students – and villagers – weren’t here befouling the air.”</p>
