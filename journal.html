            <h2 class="sub-article-title no-top">October 26th, 2013</h2>
            <p>Today was quite the interesting day. First of all, I was practically assaulted by Peeves on my way to the Great Hall for breakfast this morning. This, as one could expect from one so great as I, would naturally lead to an action of revenge. You see, soon after the breakfast (where we were told that today would be our first Hogsmeade weekend (whatever)), I decided to start forging some letters. These letters contained numerous loving conversations between Peeves and, you guessed it, Moaning Myrtle! It did not take long for the entire school to hear of it, embarrassing Peeves and Myrtle (who had screamed at me in first year, when I got curious and walked into the girls toilet after some girl told me about a “foul creature”), alike. Of course, the letters were so well forged, that the other ghosts – who know these two best – were convinced of their love, further amplifying their embarrassment!</p>
            <p>Afterwards, somewhere around noon, I was delegated to a group of other third years (and a fifth-year group leader prefect), even though I of course wouldn’t need such a pathetic thing to find my way around Hogsmeade. Alas, I was forced to ride a carriage with these people (did I even get their names? Ahh, they are unimportant anyway). Anyhow, the group consisted of another Ravenclaw, who gave me some strange feelings of desperation, a Gryffindor, who was annoyingly “friendly and outgoing”, an annoying Hufflepuff, who turned out to be scared of <span class="italics">everything</span>. Lastly, there was a woefully unimportant Slytherin girl (who seemed to lack any true intelligence or social skills) and the fifth-year girl, who seemed to catch the eye of the Ravenclaw boy immediately.</p>
            <p>As we arrived in Hogsmeade, not much happened... or that was until we visited the Shrieking Shack. There, we met a (very annoying) girl called Mavis (or more affectionately, Mad Mavis). I found her walking through a passage in the basement, apparently leading all the way to the Whomping Willow on the Hogwarts grounds. She seemed to know the Gryffindor in my group, though that was to be expected considering their... common attributes. In this basement, I also found something much more interesting, a parchment belonging to the Marauders of old. Though it seemed to be unaware of the Glorious One before it, for it did not immediately share in its secrets, however, it is most likely only a matter of time before it will recognize me as its master.</p>
            <p>It was then (after some screaming) that the fifth-year returned, telling us it was a bad idea to go here, blablabla. Luckily though, I used this opportunity (as we were not actually allowed to visit the Shrieking Shack), to <span class="strike">blackmail</span> convince her to leave us. Thus, we continued to Hogsmeade without a stuck-up and nosy prefect looking into all my business. Though, I was met with disappointment, for the only interesting activity in the entire village, was to challenge an old master in Wizard’s Chess. I, of course, challenged him, yet he cheated (quite obviously too) and was regarded as the winner, leaving the rest of the visit to the village with an air of disappointment.</p>
            <p>The most interesting part of the day came thereafter, just as we left Hogsmeade and arrived at Hogwarts once more. You see, the girl Mad Mavis had brought something with her, and thanks to an accident released it on our entire little group. It was the Sands of Time; and though I don’t know much about it, I can’t help but wonder how a girl such as her could find <span class="italics">and</span> know something about it... Thus, I headed up to the library to research it more (for I only believed it to be a legend before and hadn’t looked much into it). Sadly, I was not let inside and must delay my queries until tomorrow. Though I feel it in my body that once I know more about it, I can use it for truly wonderous things...</p>
